This methodology can also be applied to languages like Java, which create bytecode. The difficulty and accuracy of decompilation can vary per language target<sup>1</sup>.</p> <p>Decompilation has wide applications across cyber security, including:</p> <ul> <li>reverse engineering (the understanding of programs)</li> <li>vulnerability discovery (the understanding of program flaws)</li> <li>malware classification</li> <li>program repair</li> <li>and much more...</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#wiki-goals","title":"Wiki Goals?","text":"<p>This wiki has two main goals:</p> <ol> <li>Making decompilation knowledge more accessible to new-comers in the field</li> <li>Categorizing research and tooling to make future decompilation progress easier</li> </ol> <p>To accomplish the first goal, it is highly encouraged to link public code when adding a technique.
